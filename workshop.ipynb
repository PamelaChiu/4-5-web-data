In other words, if you forget to check them off before you play the ad, that’s all you get. Maybe pause the screen after the ad finishes so the player can see all of the boosters they can use.

But oh wait, even if you clear those blocks at the top 4 drops, you have to now find a way to, in a nutshell, get every nut/shell down to the ground in every move.\\n\\nI mean, I had all 4 blocks cleared, and I had used the rainbow, pink donut, and the bomb/stripe bits to give me a boost. I still ran out of moves. If you don’t play this level without any boosts, your just wasting your time.\\n\\nI mean, at the very least make it so enough of those nuts/shells we need to get to the bottom appear so that we can at least get it all done within the very limited amount of tasks!\\n\\nThis game just got too much. They wanted to keep it alive, sure, and they needed to make it challenging so people didn’t get too bored. That was my 20th time playing that level. I’m done. Deleted.\\n\\nSee you never Candy Crush!',\n",

Example: it wants you to verify by showing you 6 pictures of an animal all flipped around and only one is right side up. You’re supposed to click on the one that is right side up. The first screen just shows you a “VERIFY” tab and nothing else on the white screen so you must click VERIFY. BAM... you missed one. Then it shows you the 6 same animal all flipped around with one right side up. You click on it and occasionally you get a second chance after you see the circled checked mark but most of the time it’s just a white screen as if your computer is frozen up but it’s not, it’s Tinders program because you can back tab and then it will go back to verify your number or your email then do the exact same thing no matter how many different computers you try or your phone(since I tested it). I would not suggest this to anyone because then it locked me out saying I tried too many times and to try again later. Oh, I almost forget. I had already verified my phone number by using the code they texted me, my email by the code they texted me and and went through the picture verification where you click on all the pictures of something(a bus for me) the hit verify. I mean how many tests are required to verify that it’s not a bot to sign onto a dating app does a person have to go through then to only be locked out because the app has a glitch to a white screen or a needed up 4th verification process. Come on Tinder. Can you give us a break here? I don’t think bots are the problem on a daring app so much as the Algerians pretending to be someone they’re not and wanting us to send them money. Please fix your bugs and just let us sign on. Thanks!',\n",

I urge you to not pay money for this app as it is light years behind where it should be for something you would expect to pay for. ALSO,Stop asking me if I want to upgrade my likes. I gave the lake that I gave for a reason. I know how to upgrade them, and if I wanted to do that I would do it. DUMPSTER FIRE.',\n",

I have not violated them at all.\\nEdit 4: I’ve emailing them on the 11th October and I still haven’t gotten a reply.

It can drive you insane, because no matter how perfect your profile is, and how attractive you look, you’re most likely to just be in a spot where you don’t get a match for a week.. the algorithm system is horribly developed, and the people behind it are obviously no experts on how it should all work. I’ve been getting so much more luck on hinge, even though I’ve perfected both accounts, not to brag but many have said I’m around a 9\\\\10, but looks shouldn’t even matter obviously, its just my point is no matter how much effort you put into something on tinder it always screws you over unless you keep ip with the ridiculous algorithm such as swiping on people in a perfectly consistenct order.. too many right swipes=you’re desperate.. too many lefts= you’re not giving people a chance.. theres not even an in between. \\n\\nAnyway, download bumble, hinge or even pure.. they all give you a chance, unlike tinder \\n\\nThanks for reading, have a great day :)',\n",

I used to like Facebook back when it was first created but it’s just getting crappier and crappier with each day that passes. They do not respect freedom of speech at all what so ever. They pick and choose what they find “offensive”. Lately they’ve only been conservative voices and allowing anyone who’s not conservative or republican to say literally anything or post literally anything without getting banned or censored or having their posts flagged. They need to calm down with their \\n extremely biased censorship and ridiculous fact checking or partially false fact checking... let people speak. That’s what freedom of speech is all about. We don’t all have to agree with each other but that doesn’t mean that opinions or ideas you don’t agree with deserve to be censored. When you only allow one kind of content and information to be seen you create extreme bias and further divide people. I’ve been banned for sharing memes or saying things that aren’t even harmful or threatening to anyone... they’re supposed to be funny. I didn’t create them I only shared them... they were already on Facebook I just shared them and got banned. I’ve seen actual death threats and real violence be allowed to stay up and be on Facebook but my memes and things that are meant as jokes got me “censored” y’all are ridiculous... you just care about the money and it shows. Even censored my business page that has nothing to do with my personal profile.... real classy....

The abusive violent speak and backlash towards me personally that would accompany any conservative retweets, - never progressive or indeed far-left that I would share, violated their standards regularly yet would never be taken down or flagged by Twitter. Yet in the end my own profile was shut down after sharing posts which spoke impartially about all factual perspectives from both sides to a hot debate late last year. This sort of blatant political censorship is Orwellian, manipulative, brainwashing and infringes on human rights.
